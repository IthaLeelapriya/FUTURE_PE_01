## AI-Powered Café Website System – “Velvet Roast Café” ☕️

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Prompt Engineering Internship at Future Interns.

The objective of this project was to demonstrate how structured prompt engineering can be used to generate, refine, and optimize website content and code for a local business.

## 📌 Project Overview

For this task, I designed and developed a café website named “Velvet Roast Café” using HTML and CSS.

Instead of manually writing everything from scratch, I used a structured prompt framework to:

- Generate website layout ideas  
- Improve UI structure  
- Refine content tone and clarity  
- Fix spacing and responsiveness issues  
- Optimize navigation and section flow  

The focus was not just on writing code — but on improving output quality through better prompt design.

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Strategy

I followed an iterative workflow:

1. Defined clear context *(business type, tone, target audience)*  
2. Gave structured instructions for layout generation  
3. Added constraints *(responsive design, clean UI, smooth transitions)*  
4. Refined prompts to fix specific issues *(alignment, spacing, slider behavior)*  
5. Improved visual consistency step by step  

This demonstrated how precise prompting directly impacts technical accuracy and usability.

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- How small changes in prompt wording significantly improve output quality  
- The importance of structured instructions in AI-assisted development  
- How to debug and refine AI-generated code  
- How prompt engineering can reduce development time for small businesses  

This project strengthened my understanding of AI-assisted web development and structured prompt design.
